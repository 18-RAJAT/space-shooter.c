Thanks for your interesting in `space-shooter.c`! Since this project is intended as a personal challenge, I am not accepting external contributions at this time. I am very open to feedback, however, so feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/tsherif/space-shooter.c/issues) for anything that needs fixing.
